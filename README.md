# Arctic Horizon 2 style theme for Fen
### Manual installation
See [this](https://github.com/Tikipeter/repository.tikipeter/pull/135#issuecomment-1420132907) comment from Tikipeter.
### Installation from Kodis "File Manager"
0. (make sure Kodi settings - "Media" - "General" - "Allow file renaming and deletion" is on)
1. Open File Manager in Kodi.
2. In the RIGHT column: Navigate to "Profile Directory" - "addon_data" - "plugin.video.fen"
3. In the LEFT column: Click on "Add Source". Enter the following URL: https://oneangryman.github.io/fen.theme.ah2/ Name it whatever you want, click "Ok" and then enter the directory.
4. Still LEFT: There should be one python script in the opened directory, with focus on this item, open the context menu and select copy. You (probably) just copied the script from my repo in the left column to your fen addon_data folder in the right column.
5. In the RIGHT column: Click on the script you just copied there. A notification should pop up (ideally one not containing the word "ERROR"), which confirms the download of the theme file(s). You can check this by entering the "custom_skins" directory in the right column (empty=bad).
6. That's it. You can now delete the script (and source) with the respective context menu action or leave it there for potential updates in the future. Each time you execute it, all the AH2 theme files get replaced with the latest version from my repo.
